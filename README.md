<h3>flexi-credit is a machine learning‚Äìpowered web app that evaluates borrower risk using logistic regression. Unlike many credit scoring tools that rely on rigid data formats, this application is built to adapt to diverse spreadsheet layouts, making it accessible and intuitive for real-world datasets.</h3>

<b>The app features:</b>

1. Dynamic column mapping: easily match your own spreadsheet columns (e.g. income, salary, or monthly_income) to the expected fields

2. Data validation and preview before scoring

3. Detailed guidance and a downloadable sample to ensure clarity for first-time users

<b>üì• Input Flexibility & Data Mapping</b>
This app is designed to work with any column naming convention ‚Äî you do not need to rename your columns to match the model's expectations.

<b>üõ†Ô∏è How it works:</b>
After uploading your dataset (CSV), you‚Äôll be shown a preview.

You‚Äôll then be prompted to manually map your columns to:

Age

Monthly Income

Total Debt

Credit Utilization

Missed Payments

Credit Lines

The model will use your selections internally, so your column names can be anything (e.g. dob_year, salary, loans_outstanding etc.)

This makes the app compatible with a wide range of real-world spreadsheets exported from:

HR systems
Loan origination platforms
Manual Excel sheets
Financial APIs

<i>‚úÖ A sample dataset is also provided for reference. You may download and match your own column structure against it.</i>
